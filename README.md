#weekly_weather.py
One job of a solar support scientist is making a video which spans the last 7 days of solar activity observed by SDO.
This weekly_weather python program fulfills this duty without the need
 to locate, download, and compile the movie yourself by hand,
which frees up your time to do more exciting things.
All you need to do is schedule a cronjob to run run_weekly_weather.csh and you should not have to worry about making a week long movie every week.
